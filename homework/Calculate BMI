def BMI(height,weight): 
    return round((weight/height**2),2) #bmi is equal to weight/height^2

var1 = float(input('input your height in meters')) #initally put integer, but float allows for decimal input values

print("your body mass index (bmi) is :", BMI)

#line 2 of my code is referenced from stack overflow (I had to search up how to use the define and round(round just rounds the numbers) functions to help with my variables)
